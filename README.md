Full Stack exercise using **React** and **Node.js**.

Requires MongoDB and Node.js to be installed. (Uses Node 17.0)

A MongoDB Database Server has to be running locally, listening for connections in the default address 127.0.0.1:27017 for the application to function.

Before MongoDB can run, a folder to store the data has to exist. The default folder is **C:\\data\\db**. This folder might not be created automatically, in which case it has to be manually created.

## To run this project execute the following commands

```javascript
cd server
npm install
cd ..
npm install
npm start
```
